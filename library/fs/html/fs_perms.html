<h2 id='fs_perms'>Create, modify and view file permissions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>fs_perms()</code> objects help one create and modify file permissions easily.
They support both numeric input, octal and symbolic character
representations. Compared to <a href="../../base/html/octmode.html">octmode</a> they support symbolic representations
and display the mode the same format as <code>ls</code> on POSIX systems.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>as_fs_perms(x, ...)

fs_perms(x, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="fs_perms_:_x">x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object which is to be coerced to a fs_perms object. Can be an
number or octal character representation, including symbolic
representations.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="fs_perms_:_...">...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional arguments passed to methods.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>On POSIX systems the permissions are displayed as a 9 character string with
three sets of three characters. Each set corresponds to the permissions for
the user, the group and other (or default) users.
</p>
<p>If the first character of each set is a &quot;r&quot;, the file is readable for those
users, if a &quot;-&quot;, it is not readable.
</p>
<p>If the second character of each set is a &quot;w&quot;, the file is writable for those
users, if a &quot;-&quot;, it is not writable.
</p>
<p>The third character is more complex, and is the first of the following
characters which apply.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> 'S' If the character is part of the owner permissions and the file is not
executable or the directory is not searchable by the owner, and the
set-user-id bit is set.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> 'S' If the character is part of the group permissions and the file is not
executable or the directory is not searchable by the group, and the
set-group-id bit is set.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> 'T' If the character is part of the other permissions and the file is not
executable or the directory is not searchable by others, and the 'sticky'
(S_ISVTX) bit is set.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> 's' If the character is part of the owner permissions and the file is
executable or the directory searchable by the owner, and the set-user-id bit
is set.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> 's' If the character is part of the group permissions and the file is
executable or the directory searchable by the group, and the set-group-id
bit is set.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> 't' If the character is part of the other permissions and the file is
executable or the directory searchable by others, and the &rdquo;sticky&rdquo;
(S_ISVTX) bit is set.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> 'x' The file is executable or the directory is searchable.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> '-' If none of the above apply.
Most commonly the third character is either 'x' or <code>-</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>On Windows the permissions are displayed as a 3 character string where the
third character is only <code>-</code> or <code>x</code>.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'># Integer and numeric
fs_perms(420L)
fs_perms(c(511, 420))

# Octal
fs_perms("777")
fs_perms(c("777", "644"))

# Symbolic
fs_perms("a+rwx")
fs_perms(c("a+rwx", "u+rw,go+r"))

# Use the `&amp;` and `|`operators to check for certain permissions
(fs_perms("777") &amp; "u+r") == "u+r"
</code></pre>
