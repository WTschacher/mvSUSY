<h2 id='join_by'>Join specifications</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>join_by()</code> constructs a specification that describes how to join two tables
using a small domain specific language. The result can be supplied as the
<code>by</code> argument to any of the join functions (such as <code><a href="../../dplyr/help/left_join.html">left_join()</a></code>).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>join_by(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="join_by_:_...">...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Expressions specifying the join.
</p>
<p>Each expression should consist of one of the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Equality condition: <code>==</code>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Inequality conditions: <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, or <code>&lt;</code>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Rolling helper: <code>closest()</code>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Overlap helpers: <code>between()</code>, <code>within()</code>, or <code>overlaps()</code>
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Other expressions are not supported. If you need to perform a join on
a computed variable, e.g. <code>join_by(sales_date - 40 &gt;= promo_date)</code>,
you'll need to precompute and store it in a separate column.
</p>
<p>Column names should be specified as quoted or unquoted names. By default,
the name on the left-hand side of a join condition refers to the left-hand
table, unless overridden by explicitly prefixing the column name with
either <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;x$&#8288;</code> or <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;y$&#8288;</code>.
</p>
<p>If a single column name is provided without any join conditions, it is
interpreted as if that column name was duplicated on each side of <code>==</code>,
i.e. <code>x</code> is interpreted as <code>x == x</code>.</p>

<h3>Join types</h3>

<p>The following types of joins are supported by dplyr:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Equality joins
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Inequality joins
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Rolling joins
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Overlap joins
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Cross joins
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Equality, inequality, rolling, and overlap joins are discussed in more detail
below. Cross joins are implemented through <code><a href="../../dplyr/help/cross_join.html">cross_join()</a></code>.
</p>


<h4>Equality joins</h4>

<p>Equality joins require keys to be equal between one or more pairs of columns,
and are the most common type of join. To construct an equality join using
<code>join_by()</code>, supply two column names to join with separated by <code>==</code>.
Alternatively, supplying a single name will be interpreted as an equality
join between two columns of the same name. For example, <code>join_by(x)</code> is
equivalent to <code>join_by(x == x)</code>.
</p>



<h4>Inequality joins</h4>

<p>Inequality joins match on an inequality, such as <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, or <code>&lt;=</code>, and
are common in time series analysis and genomics. To construct an inequality
join using <code>join_by()</code>, supply two column names separated by one of the above
mentioned inequalities.
</p>
<p>Note that inequality joins will match a single row in <code>x</code> to a potentially
large number of rows in <code>y</code>. Be extra careful when constructing inequality
join specifications!
</p>



<h4>Rolling joins</h4>

<p>Rolling joins are a variant of inequality joins that limit the results
returned from an inequality join condition. They are useful for &quot;rolling&quot; the
closest match forward/backwards when there isn't an exact match. To construct
a rolling join, wrap an inequality with <code>closest()</code>.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>closest(expr)</code>
</p>
<p><code>expr</code> must be an inequality involving one of: <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, or <code>&lt;=</code>.
</p>
<p>For example, <code>closest(x &gt;= y)</code> is interpreted as: For each value in <code>x</code>,
find the closest value in <code>y</code> that is less than or equal to that <code>x</code> value.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><code>closest()</code> will always use the left-hand table (<code>x</code>) as the primary table,
and the right-hand table (<code>y</code>) as the one to find the closest match in,
regardless of how the inequality is specified. For example,
<code>closest(y$a &gt;= x$b)</code> will always be interpreted as <code>closest(x$b &lt;= y$a)</code>.
</p>



<h4>Overlap joins</h4>

<p>Overlap joins are a special case of inequality joins involving one or two
columns from the left-hand table <em>overlapping</em> a range defined by two columns
from the right-hand table. There are three helpers that <code>join_by()</code>
recognizes to assist with constructing overlap joins, all of which can be
constructed from simpler inequalities.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>between(x, y_lower, y_upper, ..., bounds = "[]")</code>
</p>
<p>For each value in <code>x</code>, this finds everywhere that value falls between
<code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;[y_lower, y_upper]&#8288;</code>. Equivalent to <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;x &gt;= y_lower, x &lt;= y_upper&#8288;</code> by
default.
</p>
<p><code>bounds</code> can be one of <code>"[]"</code>, <code>"[)"</code>, <code>"(]"</code>, or
<code>"()"</code> to alter the inclusiveness of the lower and upper bounds. This
changes whether <code>&gt;=</code> or <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;=</code> or <code>&lt;</code> are used to build the
inequalities shown above.
</p>
<p>Dots are for future extensions and must be empty.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>within(x_lower, x_upper, y_lower, y_upper)</code>
</p>
<p>For each range in <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;[x_lower, x_upper]&#8288;</code>, this finds everywhere that range
falls completely within <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;[y_lower, y_upper]&#8288;</code>. Equivalent to <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;x_lower &gt;= y_lower, x_upper &lt;= y_upper&#8288;</code>.
</p>
<p>The inequalities used to build <code>within()</code> are the same regardless of the
inclusiveness of the supplied ranges.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>overlaps(x_lower, x_upper, y_lower, y_upper, ..., bounds = "[]")</code>
</p>
<p>For each range in <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;[x_lower, x_upper]&#8288;</code>, this finds everywhere that range
overlaps <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;[y_lower, y_upper]&#8288;</code> in any capacity. Equivalent to <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;x_lower &lt;= y_upper, x_upper &gt;= y_lower&#8288;</code> by default.
</p>
<p><code>bounds</code> can be one of <code>"[]"</code>, <code>"[)"</code>, <code>"(]"</code>, or
<code>"()"</code> to alter the inclusiveness of the lower and upper bounds.
<code>"[]"</code> uses <code>&lt;=</code> and <code>&gt;=</code>, but the 3 other options use <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>
and generate the exact same inequalities.
</p>
<p>Dots are for future extensions and must be empty.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>These conditions assume that the ranges are well-formed and non-empty, i.e.
<code>x_lower &lt;= x_upper</code> when bounds are treated as <code>"[]"</code>, and
<code>x_lower &lt; x_upper</code> otherwise.
</p>



<h3>Column referencing</h3>

<p>When specifying join conditions, <code>join_by()</code> assumes that column names on the
left-hand side of the condition refer to the left-hand table (<code>x</code>), and names
on the right-hand side of the condition refer to the right-hand table (<code>y</code>).
Occasionally, it is clearer to be able to specify a right-hand table name on
the left-hand side of the condition, and vice versa. To support this, column
names can be prefixed by <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;x$&#8288;</code> or <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;y$&#8288;</code> to explicitly specify which table they
come from.
</p>

# closest match for the sale on the same date.
by &lt;- join_by(id, closest(sale_date &gt; promo_date))
left_join(sales, promos, by)

# Same as before, but also require that the promo had to occur at most 1
# day before the sale was made. We'll use a full join to see that id 2's
# promo on `2019-01-02` is no longer matched to the sale on `2019-01-04`.
